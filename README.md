# Pokemon: What their Stats say

An look at the relationship between Pokemons' different stats

## Overview

We wish to analyze the relationship between the combat stats of Pokemon: attack, defense, special attack, special defense, hp, and speed. Our goal is to see if a comparatively higher or lower value in one area gives any indication as to the value of another, and how these interactions allow for specific archetypes - such as a fast "glass cannon", or a bulky "defender".  

### Interesting Insight

This is optional but highly recommended. You'll include one interesting insight from your project as part of the README. This insight is most effective when you include a visual. Keep in mind that this visual must be included as an image file (e.g., JPG, PNG, etc.). You can export plots created with `{ggplot2}` by using the function `ggsave`.

## Repo Structure
